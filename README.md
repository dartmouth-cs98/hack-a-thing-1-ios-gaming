# Flangry Bird

An iOS game that is a Flappy Bird clone but with an Angry Birds theme.

This app was built in Swift using the SpriteKit framework. I learned a lot about Apple's app and game development ecosystem as well as how to easily implement collision handling and other requisite features. I was unable to complete a character unlock feature and a few small animation properties that I had tried.
